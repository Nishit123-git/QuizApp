# QuizApp

There are many things to learn in the world, and quizzes help in testing the understanding of those concepts. The Quiz Application will present questions to users and expect the users to respond accordingly. Think of it as a questionnaire.

Using the Quiz Application, it will be possible for special users, called administrators, to create tests, and then regular users can answer the questions and test their understanding.

      --> This project consists of setting quizzes and asking people to answer them. Therefore, users should be able to ask questions, and other users should be able to answer them. The application will then display the final score and the correct answers.
